 1. This repo has question solved from Coding ninjas, Apna college, grind 75 and leetcode.
 
 2. Few question have explaination, how exactly the logic behind the question is working
    including Time and space complexity detaiils.
 
 3. Each Directory is for specific topic.
 
 4. You may find brute force approach, better and optimal approach for few questions.
 
 NOTE: I will be updating this repository every day and solving question from leetcode, feel free give it a star.
